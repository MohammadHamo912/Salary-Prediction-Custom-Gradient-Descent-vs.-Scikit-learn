Creating a good README is essential for any project on GitHub\! Here is a structured and informative README file for your salary prediction project, covering the model you built from scratch and the comparison with Scikit-learn.

# üìà Salary Prediction: Custom Gradient Descent vs. Scikit-learn

This project implements a **Simple Linear Regression** model to predict an individual's salary based on their years of experience. The core of the project involves two implementations:

1.  A **custom Linear Regression model** built from scratch using **Gradient Descent**.
2.  A benchmark model using the highly optimized **`LinearRegression`** class from the **Scikit-learn** library.

The purpose is to demonstrate a foundational understanding of machine learning algorithms by implementing one from first principles and comparing its performance to an industry-standard library.

## üöÄ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need Python and the following libraries installed:

  * `numpy`
  * `pandas`
  * `matplotlib`
  * `scikit-learn`

You can install all necessary packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

### Files

  * **`SalaryData.csv`**: The dataset containing 'YearsExperience' and 'Salary' columns.
  * **`project_notebook.py`** (or relevant file name): The main script/notebook containing all the code for data loading, model implementation, training, and plotting.

## üß† Model Implementation

### 1\. Custom Linear Regression (From Scratch)

This section implements the fundamental components of Linear Regression using the **Gradient Descent** optimization algorithm:

  * **Hypothesis Function:** $\mathbf{f(x) = wx + b}$
  * **Cost Function:** **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, $\mathbf{J(w, b) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (f(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2}$
  * **Gradient Descent:** Iteratively updates the parameters $\mathbf{w}$ (weight/slope) and $\mathbf{b}$ (bias/intercept) to minimize the cost function:
    $$\mathbf{w = w - \alpha \frac{\partial J}{\partial w}}$$   $$\mathbf{b = b - \alpha \frac{\partial J}{\partial b}}$$
    *The learning rate $\mathbf{\alpha}$ and number of iterations were manually tuned to achieve convergence.*

### 2\. Scikit-learn Linear Regression

The standard `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression` class is used as a **benchmark**. This model uses a highly efficient closed-form solution (like the Normal Equation or Singular Value Decomposition) rather than iterative gradient descent.

## üìä Results and Comparison

The final output is a plot comparing the best-fit lines generated by both models against the original training data.

The project demonstrates that, for a simple dataset, the custom-implemented Gradient Descent model can achieve results **nearly identical** to the optimized Scikit-learn implementation, validating the core mathematical principles.

### Custom Model Parameters (Example Output)

The final optimized parameters after 10,000 iterations with a learning rate of $0.01$ are approximately:

  * **Slope ($w$):** $\approx 9394.85$
  * **Intercept ($b$):** $\approx 26970.08$
